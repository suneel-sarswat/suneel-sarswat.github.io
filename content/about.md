## About Me

**Suneel Sarswat** bridges rigorous theory and live-market reality.  
During his **PhD at TIFR**, he and his collaborators produced the world’s first fully-verified exchange checker (25 k+ Rocq lines) and six top-tier publications.  He now applies these formal methods to **regulatory technology**, having consulted on two **SEBI projects**—automated collusion detection and a confidential front-running investigation—and advised the **Ministry of Finance** on credit-rating-agency performance.

For more than a decade he has trained officers from **RBI, SEBI, NSE, BSE** and taught students and professionals at **NISM, IIM, NMIMS** how to turn data science, machine learning and financial analytics into actionable market insight.

Today he is **Adjunct Faculty at NISM** and an independent consultant and researcher specialising in advanced technology applications in finance.
